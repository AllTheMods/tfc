    "gravitas.quest.steel.desc.funnel": "Speaking of a better funnel. For this, you'll need an electron tube. There's two options here, one of them makes more than the other, but you'll need to do some Immersive Engineering for that.",
    "gravitas.quest.steel.desc.paper_making.1": "You'll need some paper to really get into Immersive Engineering, you can't make blueprints without paper. You also can't make books without paper, and having the IE manual is real useful.",

    "gravitas.quest.steel.desc.papyrus.2": "First, take one piece of papyrus and combine it with a knife. Next, you'll want to soak those strips in water for about 8 hours. Take those soaked papyrus strips and weave 'em on a loom. Lastly, like with Leather, put that unrefined paper on a log and scrape it to obtain your paper.",
    "gravitas.quest.steel.desc.saw.1": "You can use a saw to increase the output of your logs, and as a bonus you'll get sawdust which has a multitude of uses.",
